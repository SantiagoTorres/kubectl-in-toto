Project Owner
=============

This directory contains metadata created by the project owner, as well as a
dummy functionary key and a python script to generate the layout (you will need
the python reference implementation for this).

You can simply copy the root layout for verification. If you need to regenerate
the layout you can simply run the python script to generate a new root layout.
You can also edit the script to e.g., add new steps.
